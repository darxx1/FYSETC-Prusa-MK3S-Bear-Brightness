# FYSETC-Prusa-MK3S-Brightness
This is the firmware for the Prusa i3 MK3S+ clone by FYSETC, compiled based on version 3.12.1. Includes a fix that allows you to control the brightness of the display as in the original Prusa printer.

Attention!
This firmware is for Bear extruder version printer!
It is not suitable for the original version because the extruder Bear is slightly higher and the z-axis configuration fails.
Firmware for the original version of the extruder will be posted soon.
